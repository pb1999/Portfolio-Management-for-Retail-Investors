# Portfolio-Management-for-Retail-Investors
### Final Project for ECON 323 UBC.

This project aims to create a model, using Machine Learning methods, that predicts future annual returns and future annual volatility for a given number of stocks. 
After doing that, we will create an optimal portfolio depending on the risk aversion of the investor. The project is divided into three parts. The first part proves 
some general assumptions about the stock market, such as the fact that stock market returns follow a normal distribution and that an Exponential Moving Average can be
used as a proxy to identify market trends. The second part is devoted in creating the data frames of the stocks that will be analyzed and constructing the model that 
predicts future annual returns and future annual volatility. Finally, the last part of the project is to form the optimal portfolio depending on the risk aversion 
of the investor.
